As observed above, an entrenched river can be caused by either tectonic uplift in the area or when the lowering of the sea level occurs. It can also be caused by increased level of downcutting or a collapse of moraine-dammed lake downstream, or capture of the river by another river. Moreover, the process of river rejuvenation can also be the cause of river entrenchment, especially when the process has occurred due to tectonic uplift. river rejuvenation increases the power of the flowing water and, therefore, the process of erosion is accelerated. Studies show that tectonic movement, particularly movement associated\n[2]: cut back and form a valley. This valley widens through lateral erosion.The process continues gradually and if rejuvenation occurs repeatedly, new terraces form as well, resulting in a step like profile around a river. River rejuvenation In geomorphology a river is said to be rejuvenated when it is eroding the landscape in response to a lowering of its base level. The process is often a result of a sudden fall in sea level or the rise of land. The disturbance enables a rise in the rivers potential energy, increasing its riverbed erosion rate.
